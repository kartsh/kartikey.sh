Hello. I'm Kart. 

I work as a backend software engineer at AWS on [Amazon Connect Customer Profiles](https://aws.amazon.com/connect/customer-profiles/) - a cloud service to consolidate siloed end-customer data into unified profiles, generate metrics, segment them into audiences, trigger events from clickstreams, and more.

I live in Vancouver BC. In my free time, I enjoy classic sitcoms like _Community_ and _Arrested Development_, being obnoxious about music, and falling into Wikipedia holes. I also like jetskis. My favorite book that I read recently was _Red Rising_.

In a previous life, I was a big fan of [_HPMOR_](https://hpmor.com/) and spent some time on India's spelling bee circuit.
